# Ethereum Roadmap

# The merge, surge, verge, purge and a splurge

---

## ... but first

1. Merge already covered 😉
1. Layer 2 protocols & rollups now and to come
1. Why not multi-chain & bridges?

Notes:

Today there are many L2 protocols in production. Most use _settlment_ of ETH as base layer for reference.
Types:

1. Optamistic
1. ZK

# The Surge

---

## The Surge

_AKA [Ethereum sharding](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/sharding/)_

<br>

## Sharding

Sharding is the process of **splitting a database horizontally** to spread the load.
<br><br>
The work of producing, validating, and storing blocks is split up across the network.

Notes:

- scaling (surge in throughput)
- lower the cost of rollups and/or bundled transactions
- make it easier for users to operate nodes (less resources needed)

---

## Sharding

Validators in PoS are _assigned at random_ to a shard committee

<br>

---

## Sharding

1. When a validator verifies a block, they publish a signature attesting to it.
1. Everyone else, instead of verifying 100 entire blocks, now only verifies 10000 signatures.
1. Each block is broadcasted on a different **sub-network**, not everyone.

Notes:

nodes need only join the subnets corresponding to the blocks that they are responsible for (or are interested in for other reasons).

On Ethereum, this will synergistically with layer 2 rollups by splitting up the burden of handling the large amount of data needed by rollups over the entire network. This will continue to reduce network congestion and increase transactions per second.

## Sharding on [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network)

In operation today, using related methodology Ethereum will use, a shard here is a parachain:

## Sharding

_Vitalik explains: https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/07/sharding.html_

---

# The Verge

---

## The Verge

1. “Verkle trees”
2. “Stateless clients”

These technical upgrades will allow users to become network validators without having to store extensive amounts of data on their machines.

---

## The Verge

_Vitalik explains: https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/06/18/verkle.html_

_EthHub explains: https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/stateless-clients/_

In a Verkle tree's polynomial proofs you do not need to provide sister nodes; instead, you just provide the path, with a little bit extra as a proof.

---

## The Purge

will cut down the amount of space required to store ETH on a hard drive, trying to simplify the Ethereum protocol and not requiring nodes to store history.

---

## The Splurge

… “all of the other fun stuff.”
